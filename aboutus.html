    <h1> A Little About the Catatechnics</h1>
      <p> We are a FTC robotics team from Wayland Union Middle School. We make sure the students
       do all the real work including this website! We also make it a point that we all show gracious
       professionalism. Joe Harnish Senior Manager of Devops says that "FTC is a place where junior high
        students learn to function in a work place enviorment and as a team." He has helped and sponsored 
        FTC for a little less than two years now with his children being participants as well.</p>
      <h2> Our Team Set Up</h2>
      <p> Our total team makeup is a little bit diffrent than most others. It consists of 5 main groups
        the builders, the coders, our YouTubers, the recorders, and the fundraiseres (a person may be in
        more than one group). The builders handle the robots physical construction they are the ones who
        use all the nuts and bolts. The builders are also made of two teams that each come up with a robot
        symetrical to the other group. The coders are the people who make and use instructions for the robot
        of their build team. Just like the build teams the code teams makes similar code to the opposing 
        team but it is slightly diffrent so in the final competition we have a robot that is the best of 
        both worlds. Our YouTubers make videos to post online so we can be better known. The recorders
        take notes on what we do so we can see where we went wrong if there is ever to be a problem. They 
        also do all our reasearch. Finally, we have the fundraisers. Well, we have to get our money from
        somewhere and the fundraising team is in charge of just that. They raise money in several diffrent 
        ways including fundraisers and finding sponsors and collecting their donations. And thats 
        it for how our team is set up.</p>
