    <h1> A little about the catatechnics</h1>
      <p> We are a FTC robotics team from wayland union middle school. We make sure the students
       do all the real work including this website! We also make it a point that we all show gracious
       professionalism. Joe Harnish Senior Manager of Devops says that "FTC is a place where junior high
        students learn to function in a work place enviorment and as a team."</p>
